<tr><td>so i have reach the conclusion that if i WANT TO DRINK on a rooftop or at a marina bar i be go to encounter a fair share of annoy people and blasã © attitude from staff who think you should feel privileged to be there</td><tr>
<tr><td>and really it be just totally weird when you buy a hotel ROOM BASE ON photos and you show up to such an obvious bait and switch</td><tr>
<tr><td>the only good thing about the hotel be the cool revolve door and the location but other than that i i would never return we be actually go to check out at 1am and just go SLEEP AT THE airport that be how bad the bed be</td><tr>
<tr><td>I BE FAMILIAR with pod hotel and have stay at a few of them easyhotel for example</td><tr>
<tr><td>MY ISSUE BE WITH the lack of service at every level</td><tr>

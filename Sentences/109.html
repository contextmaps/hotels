<tr><th>(109),hallways,shower,mart</th><tr>
<tr><td>i be too shy to go into detail teee heeeeee the linen be not fantastic but i GUESS THEY BE clean at the very least no strange smell or itchy skin here</td><tr>
<tr><td>hallways BE NARROW AND may get crowded with laundry and trash bin</td><tr>
<tr><td>pretty much the only light in THE ENTIRE LOBBY be a little desk lamp at reception</td><tr>
<tr><td>hallways be very narrow with only 3 small than average elevator and 44 floor so the stairs be our main way to MOVE UP AND down swiftly</td><tr>
<tr><td>room be really TINY</td><tr>
<tr><td>designer 1 what if we do not have mini bar in the room so that EVERYONE HAVE TO haul their ass down to this tiny store to buy overpriced basic like water and snacks</td><tr>
<tr><td>pier 25 be really cool for kid in summer with splash pad sandbox and mini golf ice cream stand out front in summer ac room nice and cool when come in from outside can not make below 71 good shower pressure patrick door man great at his job mini fridge subway just up blockcons the ELEVATOR</td><tr>
<tr><td>the mini bar look NICE BUT WE do not touch it</td><tr>
<tr><td>shower be impressively design BUT CAN HAVE use a tad more water pressure</td><tr>
<tr><td>the room be NOT ANYTHING SPECIAL and a bit outdated</td><tr>
<tr><td>photos include guess the cleaning staff just sorta stuff some tissue in there and call IT A DAY</td><tr>
<tr><td>hallways smell like a manly musky cologne which be cool give you a sophisticate and regal feel bathroom be very nice many complain about the glazed glass i see their point but ON THE FLIP SIDE THE room be very dark thus the bathroom provide the bright light in the room and thus outside of bedtime be leave on most of the time huge tvs in room bed be comfortable and sheet crisp they provide a dollar shave club razor with a 10 gift card and 4 cartridge in the room at a cost of 12</td><tr>

<tr><td>the room also have rfid electronic lock which BE NICE</td><tr>
<tr><td>THE ELEVATOR ISSUE be a significant onethe old lift use to be glass with white xmas light they would glide up and down the atrium like star in the sky</td><tr>
<tr><td>the a c be not centralize but through a window unit that work well but can be a little noisy especially when the room BE SMALL</td><tr>
<tr><td>the room be EXTREMELY SMALL FOR THE price and can definitely use some upgrading</td><tr>

<tr><td>room be a LITTLE DATED AND can use some refurnishing</td><tr>
<tr><td>aside from the shower be decent for the AGE OF THE hotel and the shower curtain do not attack me during my shower the pedestal sink and one tiny shelf be far from useful</td><tr>
<tr><td>they be pretty big ill give it THAT BUT IT be messy and borderline prawn</td><tr>
<tr><td>the ROOM HOWEVER BE VERY outdated the sofa be old and look worn out if you be a elite or platinum member their lounge be great for snacking and breakfast</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall be NOT BAD</td><tr>

<tr><td>people drop drink everywhere loud large space and too empty to dance BUT NOT QUITE enough to be intimate</td><tr>
<tr><td>do not like the fact that our room practically HAVE NO WINDOW because they use a backlit shoji screen to cover up the window which look out into a wall</td><tr>

<tr><td>the KIND THAT BE not double pane</td><tr>
<tr><td>the downside be the room have BECOME A BIT worn</td><tr>
<tr><td>i like the white color they HAVE GO ON contrast with the blue light</td><tr>
<tr><td>LESS THAN 100 night for a single 140 for a double service be not a problem we get extra towel and an unusably uncomfortable rollaway bed with no hassle or charge room be clean and comfortable</td><tr>
<tr><td>the BIG ISSUE BE with the nonfunctional shower</td><tr>

<tr><td>con room need TO BE RENOVATE</td><tr>
<tr><td>with that be say if you be bring your FAMILY WITH KID to nyc do not stay here</td><tr>
<tr><td>for BE A SPG gold member though they do not give any free upgrade which be not normal</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you just need a place TO CRASH AND value be important give this place a try and see how it work for you but for now it be a 35 star place for me</td><tr>
<tr><td>the first day the only thing she do be MAKE OUR BED</td><tr>
<tr><td>i do not like how starwood prefer guest who book through a THIRD PARTY SITE like priceline can not get any of the amenities like free wifi</td><tr>
<tr><td>we come here for appetizer AND DRINK ON the rooftop bar use our travel zoo voucher</td><tr>
<tr><td>that most likely not a lot at a new YORK HOTEL BUT come on you can at least say good bye</td><tr>
<tr><td>came here for our anniversary and be disappoint that our room look out on the AC UNIT AND an eyesore of a building next door</td><tr>
<tr><td>however a friend of mine get the room off hotwire and offer 100 night FOR IT WHICH they take so with that price and location in mind it be pretty damn good</td><tr>
<tr><td>maybe it be new york OR MAYBE IT be me but the price tag get me a tiny room with no internet</td><tr>
<tr><td>would NOT GO OUT of my way to come here though</td><tr>
<tr><td>fortunately for me i be there on business otherwise foot that bill WOULD HAVE PUT me on ramen dinner for the rest of the month</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be give them 3 star because for the money and the level OF HOTEL THIS be it should be much good</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be not crazy early in the morning or anything but still any hotel should expect that business traveler with odd hour will be stay there so if i NEED TO SLEEP past 9am i NEED TO SLEEP past 9am</td><tr>
<tr><td>oh and have a direction liaison in the lobby be PRETTY COOL BUT I would recommend find someone who speak good english</td><tr>
<tr><td>now this be four point and not the w so i be not too upset to see the shampoo CONDITIONER AND SOAP administer from a dispenser rather than get the freebie bottle</td><tr>
<tr><td>up the epcot center be inspire future land ESCALATOR TO THE lobby where we be warmly greet by the staff at front desk</td><tr>
<tr><td>ALSO I CAN imagine that it would cultivate a sexy environment if my handsome fiance be there with me ala he be not</td><tr>
<tr><td>but I LIKE THEM for that</td><tr>
<tr><td>if one be travel with someone i may recommend save a few dollar and go for a room with A SHARE BATH because you be probably go to end up use the share bathroom down the hall anyway unless you be exhibitionist</td><tr>

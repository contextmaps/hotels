<tr><th>(86),though,hotel,okay</th><tr>
<tr><td>the staff be friendly AND POLITE BUT if something be wrong in the room do not expect it to be correct quickly</td><tr>
<tr><td>even though it be yet another open space there be an intimate vibe where you can allow time to get away from you as you chat the staff be there just enough to make you feel like you be GET YOUR DRINK AND yet they do not continue to bother you</td><tr>
<tr><td>because this be exactly the kind of place where i would feel like a chump if i finagled my way in just to hang out with a bunch of stranger and pay for MY OWN DRINK which be as expensive as the decor be beautiful</td><tr>
<tr><td>for couple i would say this would work but the room be REALLY SMALL AND you will be bump into each other quite a bit try to move around so you may want to go somewhere else with room that be a bit big in order to be comfortable</td><tr>
<tr><td>i also find the bedding to not be AS NICE AS OTHER W be i have stay at this can be completely a false statement but for some reason the bed just be NOT AS NICE AS OTHER W be i have be to</td><tr>
<tr><td>i also find the bedding to not be as nice as OTHER W BE I have stay at this can be completely a false statement but for some reason the bed just be not as nice as OTHER W BE I have be to</td><tr>
<tr><td>i ALSO FIND THE bedding to not be as nice as other w be i have stay at this can be completely a false statement but for some reason the bed just be not as nice as other w be i have be to</td><tr>
<tr><td>not my dream hotel but SERVE THE PURPOSE it be create to do</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be never inform that they have an elite lounge which mean NO FREE BREAKFAST no free internet no free apps and drink in the afternoon</td><tr>
<tr><td>once the construction be done then this hotel be go to be fantastic but right now do not expect A QUIET NIGHT be sleep</td><tr>
<tr><td>the security on watch at all time and throughout the night by the elevator be really A NICE FEATURE</td><tr>
<tr><td>the staff BE PLEASANT BUT nothing to brag about</td><tr>
<tr><td>but when the place start TO FILL UP and people be dance they transition to early 2000s hiphop</td><tr>
<tr><td>i do not care if IT BE INCONVENIENT for the hotel they need cool air and should change this around right now</td><tr>
<tr><td>and this from a concierege who accord to daughter who be study hospitatlity wear a pin signify THE HIGH LEVEL of study in the spg system</td><tr>
<tr><td>the concierge can of be a little friendly but its nyc after all SO NO BIGGIE</td><tr>
<tr><td>however if I CAN SAVE more than 2030 a night stay here i probably would since the location convenience be good enough for me to put up with the quality of the room</td><tr>
<tr><td>HOWEVER IF I can save more than 2030 a night stay here i probably would since the location convenience be good enough for me to put up with the quality of the room</td><tr>
<tr><td>nice hotel but still lacking we stay 5 night june 2016 great centralize location in manhattan make it easy to see all local site clean room friendly housekeeping staff however the bed be hard as a rock w flat pillow now for some this may be ideal but we be really uncomfortable for this hotel be price point there be some thing missing no real lobby just a couple bench once you be out of the room YOU BE BASICALLY out of the hotel friendliness of lobby and door staff be hit and miss some would acknowledge and say hi but the majority just blatantly ignore you pretty rude room service be expensive and a joke as they bring your food in a bag packaged in plastic container really</td><tr>
<tr><td>my two complaint with the property be that they do not have room ready on either visit AND THEY FORGET about my hilton diamond perk not a huge deal it be only a bottle of water but still both time too</td><tr>
<tr><td>new furnishing be offgassing which presumably will diminish before long SOMETHING BE WRONG with the room be aircon heating which mean 3 time up in the night to make adjustment</td><tr>
<tr><td>the far big problem be THE CONVENIENT LOCATION be also quite loud despite the comfortable bed i never sleep well there because of all the street noise</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you be on a HIGH FLOOR BE prepared to take a long elevator ride down as the elevator stop at almost every floor</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be look forward to come back here as it be a cool spot but sometimes i think a place can try TOO HARD</td><tr>
<tr><td>THEY HAVE LARGE bottle that they refill and charge 27 each if you walk off with one so do not make the mistake in assume that they be free which be what i think the wythe be hope you will do</td><tr>
<tr><td>and THE BIG PLUS FOR me which i be sure it be not for other people they have smoke floor room</td><tr>
<tr><td>the front desk people be helpful the room service be pretty darn GOOD TOO</td><tr>
<tr><td>DRINK I ORDER an amaretto sour which the bartender claim be the good in the world</td><tr>
<tr><td>one be constantly out of commission mean i have to endure people outside my room constantly wait FOR ONE TO arrive</td><tr>
<tr><td>there be good option out there especially WITH THE AMOUNT of hotel in one small space begging for your reservation</td><tr>
<tr><td>once enter the room it BE EXACTLY AS describe however it too have a feeling of be tired</td><tr>
<tr><td>MAYBE BECAUSE IT be such an over crowded hotel or maybe because the lobby be unkept</td><tr>
<tr><td>NICE HOTEL BUT for the price you would think they would have update technology</td><tr>
<tr><td>we enjoy the slightlymuted terrace until THEY CLOSE IT around midnight then move to the lobby near the elevator</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be not horrible though and you have all that YOU NEED INCLUDE wifi</td><tr>
<tr><td>i also find it pretty quiet which BE NICE BECAUSE its on a bussling street</td><tr>
<tr><td>guests have to muscle their way through the LOBBY AT ALL time of the day but most especially from 5 pm to 3 am</td><tr>
<tr><td>room service be NOT THAT GREAT in my opinion and the hotel staff be a bit pretentious which i have zero tolerance for</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be quite dress up but still get treated as if PERHAPS I BE LOSE</td><tr>
<tr><td>i think i would have like it well HERE IF IT be not coat so hard in douchebaggery</td><tr>
<tr><td>try it out it be not the hell hole depicted but you sure leave want a little good for what you pay AND THE COOKIE be nice</td><tr>
<tr><td>in this day and age when you CAN GET FREE wifi at budget motel and starbucks that kind of nickelanddime by highend hotel be incomprehensible</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you do not care about those sortw of thing then everything ELSE BE GOOD</td><tr>
<tr><td>another cool bonus be THEIR CAR SERVICE make sure you reserve it right away though because sometimes they only have one car and that gets book incredibly fast</td><tr>
<tr><td>this BE USUALLY PRETTY standard at most restaurant that have a popular see however the way in which the staff handle and inform us of their policy be a little abrupt and it lacked proper decorum in my opinion</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be also really NOISY AT ALL time of the day</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be start to think that i have to sacrifice size when book a hotel in nyc but i find the space in this hotel room just ENOUGH</td><tr>
<tr><td>ORDER ONE OF their jalapeno drink from their lobby bar</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be platinum elite and when i check in they do not offer me bottle water not a huge deal in the grand scheme OF THING BUT all of my elite coworkers be give water</td><tr>
<tr><td>that room would not do if your with A FRIEND</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be a NICE PLACE AND have some great idea just need to work on the small detail now to be great</td><tr>
<tr><td>luckily we sleep with the tv on anyway but the club be bang until the wee hour and people go in and out of their room all night BE SUPER LOUD as well</td><tr>
<tr><td>luckily we sleep with the tv on anyway but the club be bang until the wee hour and PEOPLE GO IN and out of their room all night be super loud as well</td><tr>
<tr><td>tv reception satellite go out occasionally AS DO THE wifi</td><tr>
<tr><td>the SERVICE BE SPOTTY AND the rest of the hotel be tired look though they be currently restore it back to its glory day</td><tr>
<tr><td>i think it may have be from either the carpet and or wall a c there be a drugstore very close by i would recommend buy some air freshner if YOU BE SENSITIVE TO smell</td><tr>
<tr><td>i think it may have be FROM EITHER THE carpet and or wall a c there be a drugstore very close by i would recommend buy some air freshner if you be sensitive to smell</td><tr>
<tr><td>the first time i stay my basic room include a bathrobe but the follow time it do not i would appreciate more consistency from the property so i know what TO EXPECT</td><tr>
<tr><td>it do not seem to be tie to it kick on or off so it be possible it be come from pipe or even other room but it be quite loud enough to wake me up though i be admittedly a fairly LIGHT SLEEPER</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be big enough to accommodate most exhibitor and spectator but IT BE TIGHT</td><tr>
<tr><td>one plus that this hotel have over the W ON LEXINGTON be that the room be much more spacious relatively for nyc so you do not have to worry about bump into thing if you need to get up in the middle of the night when nature call :) as long as your toilet be not break</td><tr>
<tr><td>the cocktail be great also just do not expect fast SERVICE AND YOU will have a good time</td><tr>
<tr><td>i will say that the lobby of the hotel and THE EXTERIOR BE pretty</td><tr>
<tr><td>FOR ITS PRICE and what it pretend to be the wow factor at thor be completely missing</td><tr>
<tr><td>drink be soso and though i do not SEE THE BILL i be sure they be staggeringly overpriced</td><tr>
<tr><td>like in most fancy hotel and ESPECIALLY IN NEW york there be amenities but it be all pay for like a wireless internet connection or business service which for me be very important</td><tr>
<tr><td>okay maybe that be my fault for not read but I STILL THINK it be strange</td><tr>
<tr><td>okay maybe that be my FAULT FOR NOT read but i still think it be strange</td><tr>
<tr><td>all the other component of have a really nice hotel BE THERE JUST hire a good plumber</td><tr>
<tr><td>the location be good for people who be here on business at one of these place than it be for people who be HERE ON VACATION not much night life in the area</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be frost BUT ONE CAN still make out the shape of the person</td><tr>
<tr><td>hotel swag factor 5 star swankedthefout hotel staff 5 star helpful QUICK AND FRIENDLY entertainment 5 star smash the dance floor for 3 straight hour to dope dj track logistics 2 star valet parking be disorganized super slow patron 2 star the jersey shore show may be over but if you want to see their groupie its deepdish on display all up in here as well as cast lookalikes from the real housewife of nj mob wives and jerseylicious if one of these mofos refer to me as ay yo louie again i be go to flip on em</td><tr>
<tr><td>the parking garage they use which be 30 day be on THE SAME STREET as the hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>the cabin be quite small so as long as you do not PLAN ON SPEND MUCH time in the room it be okay</td><tr>
<tr><td>their rooftop bar skews VERY YOUNG AND drink be not exactly great or a value but with view like theirs you seem to forget about the pretension</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be give this place three STAR AND THAT mostly for the bed which be the only positive thing i happen to remember</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be a good thing there be a giant hotel sign hang on this building otherwise it LOOK JUST LIKE every other old factory building in this neighborhood</td><tr>
<tr><td>service in the lounge area be pretty decent but the hotel do lack a lot with no spa no access to the blonde bar in the evening because it turn into some b level euro dance scenewhich you get no access to even as a guest and there BE NO GYM which be something i use while on business travel</td><tr>
<tr><td>ON THE BEDSIDE table be a little black package think maybe a mint</td><tr>
<tr><td>small bathroom and room in general OVERALL OUR STAY at nylo be okay the staff be friendly and check in and out be a breeze and walkablity be excellent</td><tr>
<tr><td>if it be a dog friendly hotel i expect THE FEE TO go towards a deep cleaning so the room do not smell like they do</td><tr>
<tr><td>wifi BE COMPLIMENTARY BUT you can upgrade to faster wifi for additional</td><tr>
<tr><td>also no minifridge SO BE PREPARE to throw away any left over</td><tr>
<tr><td>YOU STEP IN and see the tiniest room with bare bone furnishing</td><tr>
<tr><td>the rest of the room look CLEAN SO THAT be odd housekeep obviously do a rush job</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be a good place to show yoru date or significant other HOW MUCH YOU like them</td><tr>
<tr><td>there be mostly sweet kitty that live in the carlton though they do get into a slapping contest at 3am one NIGHT</td><tr>
<tr><td>the king bed be one of the good hotel bed i have even collapse into which count for probably more than ANYTHING ELSE IN this review since you will likely log the most hour on a mattress during your stay as be the fundamental nature of hotel duh</td><tr>
<tr><td>place have the kind of vibe where you actually do not feel that strange order a 15 pink panther rum vodka grenadine champagne and i feel like i be miss an ingredient OR TWO BUT i would recommend against it unless you have build up a strong tolerance for odd alcoholic mixture</td><tr>
<tr><td>otherwise you WILL BE DISAPPOINT there be no extra frill bell or whistlles to this room</td><tr>
<tr><td>OTHERWISE YOU WILL be disappoint there be no extra frill bell or whistlles to this room</td><tr>
<tr><td>otherwise you will be DISAPPOINT THERE BE no extra frill bell or whistlles to this room</td><tr>
<tr><td>luckily none of these people be get laid otherwise it be like a throwback those good ol dorm room DAY</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be new york so they be SMALL AND BE EXPECT to be rather small</td><tr>
<tr><td>you either stay on the top FLOOR TO BE the first one on when the elevator be packed or you be on the low FLOOR TO BE the first one off but never get on during rush our</td><tr>
<tr><td>the room be SMALL SO I have to end up go across the bed most time</td><tr>
<tr><td>i never spend too much time in my hotel room while in new york so if i can find a safe place for my luggage and A CLEAN PLACE for my sleepy head i do not get too picky about the detail</td><tr>
<tr><td>i never spend too much time in my hotel room while in new york so if i can find a safe place for my luggage and a clean place for my sleepy head i do NOT GET TOO picky about the detail</td><tr>
<tr><td>they be in the midst OF A RENOVATION so the lobby be a mess and there be no signage anywhere</td><tr>
<tr><td>i would give it A HIGH RATING except the wait time for elevator be slow</td><tr>
<tr><td>the first night i can hear the couple in the ROOM ABOVE US go at it if you know what i mean lol</td><tr>
<tr><td>all OF THEM</td><tr>
<tr><td>the hotel also have a rooftop where YOU CAN RELAX and enjoy a drink or two with your friend or significant other</td><tr>
<tr><td>i do not deal much with the staff so i can not give a very detailed review on overall SERVICE BUT THE check in process be smooth</td><tr>
<tr><td>they try PRETTY HARD TO make a strong first impression but a few thing on the follow through somewhat disappoint me</td><tr>
<tr><td>but I DO ENJOY your 50s era lounge</td><tr>
<tr><td>have IT BE TYPICAL ny summer weather i would have be die</td><tr>
<tr><td>i di come TO THE ALOFT hotel on a cold winter night</td><tr>
<tr><td>i do not know if it be worth the price though it be certainly in a great LOCATION</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be NOT HAPPY ABOUT the hefty wifi charge though</td><tr>
<tr><td>plus love that THEY HAVE BLISS PRODUCT in the roomoh and can you do something about the lady of the night look for a good time in the wee hour i know it be a tourist hotel but still</td><tr>
<tr><td>the only downside be really that there be black mold in my room they give me the SAME ROOM AS the previous reviewer who complain of this but overall it be decent</td><tr>
<tr><td>the hotel be JUST OKAY</td><tr>
<tr><td>i have to admit it DO NOT NECESSARILY look unclean but it do not feel clean either</td><tr>
<tr><td>which be great but IF YOUR ON the 2nd floor you will not have any peace until 4am</td><tr>
<tr><td>con this be NOT A BUSINESS HOTEL</td><tr>
<tr><td>i can think of a lot of more productive thing i CAN DO WITH that money than to kill some brain cell</td><tr>

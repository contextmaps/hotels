<tr><td>i fiddle with it for three day set it everywhere from 66 to 72 and never be able to actually get the room to any of those temperature except very briefly in between extreme think of the planet crematoria in the movie the chronicles of riddick it be tolerable during the transition between hot and cold and BACK AGAIN</td><tr>
<tr><td>hotel staff be FINE</td><tr>
<tr><td>i have not look YET BUT I bet there be dozens of youtube video show it in action</td><tr>
<tr><td>i actually do not know the place exist for a while and feel obligated to share so the world KNOW HOW GREAT they be</td><tr>

<tr><td>go for the rooftop BRUNCH WHICH BE all you can drink veuve champagne</td><tr>

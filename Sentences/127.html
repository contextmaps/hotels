<tr><td>overall i would give it 35 star if i can the customer service staff be impeccable the room be very clean and the bedding sheet BE COMFORTABLE HOWEVER THE mattress be pretty stiff</td><tr>
<tr><td>this place certainly have its cool factor but i will probably stay SOMEWHERE ELSE NEXT time since there be good similarlypriced place in nyc with at least hot water</td><tr>
<tr><td>public space outside i applaud a company for provide an environment that the community can enjoy and have clear posted community guideline BE GREAT</td><tr>
<tr><td>the MUSIC BE GOOD decent amount of popish electronic and it be not super loud make conversation very easy</td><tr>
<tr><td>but expect the room to be A LITTLE OLD AND design to the standard of yesteryear and thus date</td><tr>
<tr><td>on a more positive note the hotel be overall NICE COMFORTABLE BED decent breakfast central location</td><tr>
<tr><td>the actual room our room seem large than some of the ONE I GET a glimpse of walk by and there be the standard old tv set and decent desk</td><tr>
<tr><td>all in all it be NOT A SUPER great stay but it serve its purpose as somewhere to shower poop and sleep warmly at night</td><tr>

<tr><td>this place HAVE THE POTENTIAL to be the place to stay in greenpoint but they really need to work on that noise</td><tr>
<tr><td>again we be happy for our 3 day but for the money be charge at A W YOU have a right to expect more</td><tr>
<tr><td>the lobby BE VERY PRETTY and make me hopeful that the 4 star rating would be reflect in the room but sadly that be not the case</td><tr>
<tr><td>yesteryear and a half ago my mom be boyfriend at the time give me a little tip when visit nyc do not stay in manhattan unless YOU INTEND TO spend spend spend</td><tr>
<tr><td>due mostly TO THE CONSTRUCTION i probably would not stay here over any of the other w be in the city</td><tr>
<tr><td>due mostly to the construction i probably would not stay here over any of the other w be in the CITY</td><tr>
<tr><td>room be clean but can HAVE BE CLEANER you can see the wear and tear on some of the furniture in the room but aside from that i would def stay again and the staff be amazing</td><tr>
<tr><td>on my multiple stay it be just the little touch like this that make me not give the hilton a good REVIEW</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be only give 3 star because i have a bit OF A BAD experience but the w staff do try their good to make thing good so i definitely would not use this one experience from stop me to visit again</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall i would stay at this location again if i get a room with the updated bathroom and on a LOW FLOOR SO i can just take the stairs</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall it be not a bad place the LOCATION MAKE UP for a lot of the shortcomings but if you be stay more than a few day or be go to spend substantial time in the room this be probably not for you</td><tr>
<tr><td>rate 4 starsrestaurant i eat here twice once for dinner and once for breakfast I WILL WRITE a more detailed review for the restaurant and have an average experience consider both meal</td><tr>
<tr><td>the good attribute about this hotel BE LOCATION LOCATION and location</td><tr>
<tr><td>the good attribute about this hotel be location location AND LOCATION</td><tr>
<tr><td>however i would probably recommend someone just stay in nyc if they have no reason to be in jersey city i WOULD NOT NECESSARILY consider this a close substitute for stay in nyc</td><tr>
<tr><td>i get that ny hotel room be small we STAY AT W and at the westin so it be not like this be my only experience</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be a 3 night trip so it be fine but i think if we be stay 5 or so more day i would have need a big hotel with MORE TO DO at the actual hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>i want to love 70 park really I DO BUT i guess kimpton have spoil me</td><tr>

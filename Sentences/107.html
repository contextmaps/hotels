<tr><td>the guy be a ball of energy great dance move AND A PERFECT smile</td><tr>
<tr><td>so while i have some MINOR ISSUE WITH some of the stuff at the hotel i would definitely recommend this hotel if you can get a reasonable deal</td><tr>
<tr><td>bottom line if you be willing to deal with a slightly long subway ride to the sight in manhattan and be on a budget at the time we stay it be about 200 a NIGHT CHEAP THAN comparable hotel in manhattan give aloft a try</td><tr>
<tr><td>i stay in a single with share bathroom AND I THOROUGHLY enjoy my stay there</td><tr>
<tr><td>THE POD 51 BE A great deal</td><tr>
<tr><td>the pod 51 be a GREAT DEAL</td><tr>
<tr><td>wish the place to eat inside be less pricey OR THERE BE more variety or something</td><tr>
<tr><td>parking be an eyepopping 54 night but YOU CAN BEAT the system on saturday night by parking on the street the muni meter be free all day sunday as long as you pay after 6pm on saturday evening the 6 hour limit be perfect and only cost 5 or so</td><tr>

<tr><td>i agree with what other poster have say it be NOT THE BIG nice or swanky but it be an excellent place to stay</td><tr>
<tr><td>that be not so at this particular w it be a bit on the quieter side AND WE LIKE it like that</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be there for work so do not eat at the restaurant OR HANG OUT much at the hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>not a huge DEAL IF YOU have a travel companion</td><tr>
<tr><td>i think if you really hunt you can probably find a decent HOTEL FOR WHAT we pay with a bit of a big room but if you be prepare for a pod i think you will like this place</td><tr>
<tr><td>you will spend a wellmade cocktail will cost you 13 but they run beer pitcher special for brunch and HAVE A SOLID 58pm happy hour with special as well</td><tr>
<tr><td>and it be so dark too after a week here you start to feel like a vampire live in a cave and you just want to know what you look like but hey vampire be hip RIGHT NOW SO that can be a sell point for the hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>everything else be so ridiculously GREAT THAT YOU JUST have to come here if you need to stay in the area</td><tr>
<tr><td>i come here to meet a few friend for drink on the terrace which be pretty SPECTACULAR</td><tr>
<tr><td>great PLACE TO HANGOUT and great mãºsica to dance lol amazing view and it be worth go</td><tr>
<tr><td>the other time i BE THERE THERE be a japanese girl play an electric violin to all the music which be niffty</td><tr>
<tr><td>WHILE NOT A problem in itself though it can be a bit intimidating for us mere mortals some of them have a bit ok a lot of an attitude</td><tr>
<tr><td>for our purpose it BE PERFECT</td><tr>
<tr><td>breakfast be expensive drink be expensive parking be expensive AND DINNER BE expensive although why would you eat at the hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>i have be a member since soho house open and even though i do not go that much i keep my membership for the summer and because THEY NOW HAVE a location in la</td><tr>
<tr><td>the liquor be not in the forefront which be hard to find IN A COCKTAIL sometimes richardson i be look at you</td><tr>
<tr><td>there be a number of hd channel BUT NOT ALL be hd</td><tr>
<tr><td>be a little hard for cabbies to find i think there BE SOME WEIRD one way streets around there and when you come from the north it be hard to pull right up to it</td><tr>
<tr><td>be A LITTLE HARD for cabbies to find i think there be some weird one way streets around there and when you come from the north it be hard to pull right up to it</td><tr>
<tr><td>glass elevators offer a great VIEW</td><tr>
<tr><td>i do not usually get out in brooklyn but an area bar crawl organize by a brooklynite friend afford me the opportunity to stop through this charming oldtimey nonhotel HOTEL BAR</td><tr>
<tr><td>the hotel gansevoort have AN AMAZING ROOFTOP deck that remind me of the skybar at the mondrian in la</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be not take anything away from it but I PERSONALLY PREFER the tavern burger that be more make to order and have a brioche roll or a really nice roll</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be light by the sunset OR THE CITY light and have a staff that look straight out of a calvin klein ad</td><tr>
<tr><td>my friend and i visit both gspa and the rooftop bar on FRIDAY NIGHT BE not impress with the crowd at either location</td><tr>
<tr><td>we do not attend THE BAR SINCE we spend most of our time outside the hotel but it look pretty happen with a mix of european and american tourist</td><tr>
<tr><td>we book through hotwire be hot rates and FEEL WE GET a great value</td><tr>
<tr><td>this be an expensive hotel but relative to nyc price if you have more than one person in the room this be a good base for A VISIT</td><tr>
<tr><td>the CROWD CAN BE mix depend on the night it be a little bridge and tunnely on a sit when all the sensible nycers have head to their summer share in the hampton but still not enough that you have to wade through bad drakkar noir and kenneth cole loafers</td><tr>
<tr><td>what more do YOU NEED</td><tr>
<tr><td>nice layout and dj play housey track at night AT LEAST ON weekend</td><tr>
<tr><td>nice to meet up new people OR JUST TO shake you butt =p</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FOR WHAT we need a clean place to crash that be welllocated</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be absolutely perfect for what we NEED A CLEAN place to crash that be welllocated</td><tr>
<tr><td>the whateverwhenever concierge ALONE MAKE THIS place worth it</td><tr>
<tr><td>in any event the metropolitan contrary to what be be say here have room larger than average i have stay at over two dozen MANHATTAN HOTEL AND i would put the room i have early this week at the metropolitan in the topthird in term of room size include the w right down the street my room there be about 20 small and i pay 350 instead of 129</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you have time its a fun place to grab a table with some FRIEND AND ENJOY SOME DRINK and snacks while overlook the manhattan skyline</td><tr>
<tr><td>i have HEAR THAT IT be hipster central and funky so i be honestly a little apprehensive about it</td><tr>
<tr><td>2 the pillow and bed be darn comfortable3 the bathroom product be from bliss lowend line4 it be less than seven block to central park and i can see it from my window5 it be five BLOCK TO TIMES square if you like that sort of tourist trap6 the staff be really nice which go a long way7 it be not that small a room</td><tr>
<tr><td>yah room be small but MOST ROOM IN nyc be small unless you get a suite for 400 a night</td><tr>
<tr><td>the one downfall be the neighborhood and the only reason it BE GET 4 star and not 5</td><tr>
<tr><td>we have one issue with our lock not work the first night and second night hear a little BIT OF NOISE down the hall but over the course of our 6 night stay we highly enjoy stay at st marks by the way the location be fantastic</td><tr>
<tr><td>while it be not the big room in the world i end up pay 165 200 after taxis A NIGHT WHILE their own web site with a low price guarantee for posted rate advertise the same room specs for twice as much</td><tr>
<tr><td>while it be not the big room in the world i end up pay 165 200 after taxis a night while their own web SITE WITH A low price guarantee for posted rate advertise the same room specs for twice as much</td><tr>
<tr><td>a very SOLID 4 STAR BECAUSE you really can not beat the location</td><tr>
<tr><td>andaz be hyatt be new hotel concept that will do definite damage to starwood be w chain particularly AS THE W brand become ubiquitous and andaz can remain boutique</td><tr>
<tr><td>do not visit the rooftop bar during my most recent stay so i can not SAY MUCH ABOUT that</td><tr>
<tr><td>hotel delmano have be on my togo list for age but as we be IN THE THICK OF this recession i be in more of a can of pbr and well whiskey shot type of financial situation</td><tr>
<tr><td>and if it be crowded the bar at the back BE ALWAYS LIVELY and the bartender be very friendly</td><tr>
<tr><td>do this only if you need to saturate your stay in new york with a bunch of pretentious european tourist eat subpar look flatbread pizza and sip white wine while tap away ON THEIR LAPTOP</td><tr>

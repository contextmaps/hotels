<tr><td>but before help us the manager proceed to say oh but if you be unpleased your husband be in the room already for an hour now what difference do that make if both PARTY BE NOT there</td><tr>
<tr><td>however they take a GOOD THING AND make it very generic</td><tr>
<tr><td>we stay for 3 day and they do NOT CLEAN OUR room once which be super aggravating consider we be out of the room early and go throughout the day also the electronic key that they give us take about 58 swipe before work and we have to get new card because they stop work the second night</td><tr>

<tr><td>FIRST IMPRESSION THE restaurant and its area do not look inviting and the building look rundown</td><tr>
<tr><td>good LOCATION AND GOOD amenities for casual business downstairs</td><tr>
<tr><td>you can not go wrong with 3 layer of different music r b hiphop on the bottom rap in THE MIDDLE AND dance edm on top</td><tr>
<tr><td>but dessert be just OK AND THE service be hmm well not good</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall it be AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE</td><tr>
<tr><td>stay 2 night and while i be wow at first by the design of the space and room i find this hyattfunded experiment to be A LITTLE LACKING in the area which matter most the functional side of be a hotel in midtown manhattan for the business traveler</td><tr>

<tr><td>stay here this WEEK IF YOU get the chance try and get the upgrade to the 19th floor it be actually pretty sick private balcony floor to ceiling shower view of the city from the shower etc</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be also very easy to get to only one turn off of the turnpike which BE GOOD SINCE the rest of jersey city look pretty scary</td><tr>
<tr><td>ok choice but there BE GOOD VALUE out there even in the upscale neighborhood</td><tr>
<tr><td>the view be okay not that worth it if you be a tourist and look for that BUT THE DESIGN of the place be quite memorable</td><tr>

<tr><th>(74),star,coolfactor,really</th><tr>
<tr><td>one star gets knock off for the bizarre people here mostly high on pinstriped suit with some cleavage on their arm but NOT MUCH ELSE</td><tr>
<tr><td>when one be ON BUSINESS THE choice for dining be slim to none</td><tr>
<tr><td>but i do expect more from THE SPG BRAND than from a hostel because i be pay a high price</td><tr>
<tr><td>all of the w be obviously have this theme in an attempt to GET AT THE just become a businessperson market</td><tr>
<tr><td>ah my first trip to ny in almost three year since i move from THERE</td><tr>
<tr><td>not my FIRST CHOICE BUT this hotel be good if you be in a pinch make sure to use the aaa rate</td><tr>
<tr><td>weekend serve until 1030 urban roomsthe reason this place be a 3 star it really come down to the small detail there BE A LACK of human interaction</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be far put off that where previously all i have to do be exit the hotel and the doorman would summon a cab the SECOND TIME AROUND THE doormen be nowhere to be find</td><tr>
<tr><td>note i do not stay at this hotel but be at a conference here i would have stay at this hotel but the conference rate room be all take so THE RATE WOULD HAVE be 529 night</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be a winsome losesome place priced maybe just a smidge too much but if it come down to it i GUESS YOU CAN do bad</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be a winsome losesome place priced maybe just a smidge too MUCH BUT IF it come down to it i guess you can do bad</td><tr>
<tr><td>for the price WE PAY I be hope for something more extravagant</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you be stay here definitely go downstairs for your morning cup instead of use the disgusting stuff in THE ROOM</td><tr>
<tr><td>not go TO RAVE ABOUT this place but it be totally tolerable</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be a nice hotel but i would probably just pay a little MORE TO BE somewhere else</td><tr>
<tr><td>i WOULD GO THERE again just for the view and the atmosphere</td><tr>
<tr><td>i can not spreak for the menu but i think IT WOULD MAKE a great place to take a date</td><tr>
<tr><td>as for me i WILL STICK TO live in queens and only mooch hotel room off my friend when they be visit</td><tr>
<tr><td>the slipper be harsh like you WOULD GET AT A pedicure place</td><tr>
<tr><td>I WOULD PROBABLY COME BACK here for one of the movie screening on sundaysnights</td><tr>
<tr><td>the breakfast be very good a regular option of bacon pancake egg ceral coffe juice i be very impressed all in all not bad for a last minute deal BUT NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT</td><tr>
<tr><td>the breakfast be very good a regular option of bacon pancake egg ceral coffe juice i be very impressed all IN ALL NOT bad for a last minute deal but nothing to write home about</td><tr>
<tr><td>the breakfast be very good a regular option of bacon pancake egg ceral coffe juice i be very impressed all in all not BAD FOR A last minute deal but nothing to write home about</td><tr>
<tr><td>I KNOW ITS not the ritz but i just like them so when i be plan a little get away to nyc i know i usually stay at the newark airport location or the one near the meadowlands but this trip i want to stay close to the city marriotts site brag that this location be all new</td><tr>
<tr><td>anyways the view be really nice and the dj be pretty good but there BE A WEIRD vibe that be more businessy or bring your own trophy wife y bottom line pregame here if you can afford it and then go somewhere else</td><tr>
<tr><td>i be disappoint in this HOTEL</td><tr>
<tr><td>all that be say i BE JUST HERE and have a decent time so i can not completely knock it but it be not necessarily amazing either</td><tr>
<tr><td>for almost 600 night i would have EXPECT AT LEAST queen bed and a refrigerator.no refrigerator in our room</td><tr>
<tr><td>it BE VERY DIFFERENT from the hotel we have stay at before</td><tr>
<tr><td>this stay BE FOR BUSINESS</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall GIVE THE PRICE it be adequate but not the kind of hotel where you feel pampered and in turn do not mind hand out your hardearned dollar hand over fist</td><tr>
<tr><td>i have go for tea elsewhere in the city and all have be really great but there be something SPECIAL ABOUT THE plaza</td><tr>
<tr><td>the dj and subsequent tune here be not really to MY TASTE BUT the drink definitely be 5 stiff cosmopolitan be the special of my most recent visit i do not really care much for the drink itself but the price be just right well drink were 9 and all others be above the 12 mark</td><tr>
<tr><td>i really do expect more FROM A HYATT</td><tr>
<tr><td>i GIVE IT THREE STAR BECAUSE it be average</td><tr>
<tr><td>i wish i can give this place less star BUT THE ONLY reason i give it 3 star be because of the amazing view of brooklyn and manhattan be</td><tr>
<tr><td>i have to say when in nyc i try not to spend much time in my hotel room but this be definitely a nice place TO COME HOME to at 3am or even at midnight</td><tr>
<tr><td>that say if you be spend over 300 or want frill would definitely think you can get MUCH GOOD ROOM elsewhere</td><tr>
<tr><td>this hotel due to it be lack of privacy inside the room be only beneficial for someone TRAVEL SOLO</td><tr>
<tr><td>i WOULD PROBABLY STAY HERE again since we get it on hotwire for 169 night</td><tr>
<tr><td>so far a 4 or 5 star place and if i HAVE NOT EAT it would be</td><tr>
<tr><td>drink be OVER PRICED BUT come on you be not really here for that be you</td><tr>
<tr><td>she advise us to get a pitcher when really the 092 drink be THE CHEAP OPTION</td><tr>
<tr><td>if my husband and i be to have breakfast for TWO IN THE room order room service it would have cost 60 per day</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be not great and i have STAY IN BAD</td><tr>
<tr><td>next TIME IF I feel dare i may try the absinthe which come in a big jar with four spigots</td><tr>
<tr><td>i agree the room be not that great but it be definitely okay to use FOR SLEEP AND showering</td><tr>
<tr><td>this would have be a really stressful situation as we can NOT FIND ANOTHER pet friendly hotel at the last minute</td><tr>
<tr><td>the computer room be pretty bad i can not open my webmail not sure WHY BUT I think it be because the network be abysmally slow</td><tr>
<tr><td>may i just say that i be not COOL ENOUGH TO stay here and i wouldnt have have it not be for my husband be eversurprising metrosexual coolness</td><tr>
<tr><td>i would GIVE IT MORE STAR if the elevator be not awful</td><tr>
<tr><td>we stay the week of march 18 and find the lobby extremely crowded and somewhat CONFUSE AT FIRST</td><tr>
<tr><td>but although that be nice when on vacation in nyc how much time BE YOU REALLY go to spend up there</td><tr>
<tr><td>we score what we think to be a good rate from living social.com for two night 358 which COME WITH 2 drink pass</td><tr>
<tr><td>i stay HERE WITH SOME friend and be not really impressed</td><tr>
<tr><td>the no topsheet thing freaks me OUT A LITTLE</td><tr>
<tr><td>unfortunately I HAVE MIX FEELING ABOUT THIS particular hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>i really like how everything be in walking distance for me i visit new york often for business to it be important for me to STAY SOMEWHERE IN walk distance because the traffic be always such a bitch</td><tr>
<tr><td>http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-central-terminal-new-york#hrid:ckpnq06wo5r3bkbkief_1q/src:selfthe other thing be if you have stay at hyatt be or any other hotel at other location anywhere else do not expect the room at any nyc hotel to be the same size AS ANY OTHER CITY</td><tr>
<tr><td>i know that be new york but as a vega escort i be USE TO SEE much much well</td><tr>
<tr><td>look at this hotel from a coolfactor i would have give it a 4 star look at this hotel from a coolfactor i would have give it a 4 STAR BUT from overall design i have a few complaint</td><tr>
<tr><td>look at this hotel from a coolfactor i would have give it a 4 star look at this hotel from a coolfactor i would have give it a 4 star but from overall design i have A FEW COMPLAINT</td><tr>
<tr><td>so i will be generous and round up to 3 star but it be definitely NOT A 4 which be what it come up as on hotwire.com</td><tr>
<tr><td>i have only be to 34 ROOFTOP BAR SO far since i have move to nyc and so far 230 5th beat all of them for the view</td><tr>
<tr><td>the room be much small than expect however it be NOT TOO MUCH of a burden as i be barely in the room only to sleep at night</td><tr>
<tr><td>we be also frustrated as spg aficionados that many of the location within the hotel would not allow you to CHARGE TO THE room like tenoverten the nail salon</td><tr>
<tr><td>i would probably come back FOR DRINK ONLY</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall i would stay here again if the price be reasonable and it be only the two of US</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be an overall good experience with pleasant staff and excess space for our stay but the key flaw of the suite itself will prohibit ME FROM STAY with them again</td><tr>
<tr><td>the reason it get the 3 star though BE LOCATION</td><tr>
<tr><td>but we be too lazy and also recognize the fact that we would not be spend much TIME IN THERE we think good of it</td><tr>
<tr><td>i only give IT A 3 STAR because of their breakfast buffet</td><tr>
<tr><td>some folk have comment on the attire of the staff and i can confirm that THE WAITRESS DO look somewhat like cheap hooker be that a bad thing</td><tr>
<tr><td>i will not fault a club for be loud it be JUST NOT MY SCENE although i enjoy trespass for a bit</td><tr>
<tr><td>however when the guy check us in and give us a free upgrade i be think something a little big than what i would consider a normal ROOM</td><tr>
<tr><td>we would stay there again although it be pricey 429 a night which end up to be close TO 500 A night after taxis and surcharge but what can we expect for manhattan standard</td><tr>
<tr><td>this be a place i frequent WHEN I USE to work in fashion</td><tr>
<tr><td>over time i have BE FORTUNATE TO patronize a few topdrawer hotel and resort</td><tr>
<tr><td>this be a priceline name your price deal for US</td><tr>
<tr><td>unfortunately even though we be plat elite get no UPGRADE</td><tr>

<tr><th>(99),tv,console,small</th><tr>
<tr><td>con of THE SECOND STAY</td><tr>
<tr><td>the bed be sideways which be wierd the bathroom be extremely SMALL AS WELL and the shower door be see through</td><tr>
<tr><td>add the horribly lighted room tight space and thin paper wall the 70 park avenue be in need of A FACE LIFT</td><tr>
<tr><td>the hotel be decently size but it be much SMALL THAN EXPECT and they charge me a bogus charge of 38 for eat gummy bear in the mini bar where there be so indication of price be on the mini bar</td><tr>
<tr><td>the breeze keep come in the room from THE WINDOW IT be close but feel open</td><tr>
<tr><td>we stay in this hotel for 3 night and it BE PRETTY NICE THE only issue we really have be the elevator and the lack of a fridge and coffeemaker in the room</td><tr>
<tr><td>we stay in this hotel for 3 night and it be pretty nice the only issue we really have be the elevator and the lack of a fridge and COFFEEMAKER IN THE room</td><tr>
<tr><td>no coffee in the room which mean to caffeinate in the morning you have to LEAVE THE BUILDING</td><tr>
<tr><td>I DO APPRECIATE THE frequent refill on water and the clean bathroom</td><tr>
<tr><td>would have be nice to have a fridge in the room to keep water COLD BUT THE room be so small not sure where they can put it</td><tr>
<tr><td>the console surround the tv have little shelf and storage area to keep random THING</td><tr>
<tr><td>the not so good room have offgassing smell like maybe from the hardwood floor glue it be a new renovation i get used to it but feel like it be an irritant the food here be exorbitant 40 for granola AND COFFEE FOR room service on the low floor the noise at madison and 24th be annoying the bed be hard make creaking sound and be not comfortable and the ac have a loud compressor that wake me up nearly every time it come on</td><tr>
<tr><td>do not like the bathroom door because it do not lock plus there be a small sliver of space all around it so that IT BE SLIGHTLY SMALL than the door frame way to decrease our privacy even more</td><tr>
<tr><td>do not like the bathroom door because it do not lock plus there be a small sliver of space all around IT SO THAT it be slightly small than the door frame way to decrease our privacy even more</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be a new hotel so it be clean but our room be near the ICE MACHINE SO we hear the clinking of ice all night long</td><tr>
<tr><td>i think it be a good idea to invest in portable electric kettle see 50 room service for mac and cheese below low toilet no conditioner SO BRING YOUR own</td><tr>
<tr><td>dark hallway not very helpful and sometimes absent front desk empty bar and hotel on a sunday night bedroom that do not have many light either and that look out onto AN OFFICE BUILDING</td><tr>
<tr><td>bed be comfortable enough tv be old but WHO CARE ABOUT that when you can look at</td><tr>
<tr><td>the bed be comfortable they can probably use A GOOD CLEANING</td><tr>
<tr><td>do have oatmeal packet but no nut or raisin to augment free wifi be so spotty slow temperamental it be almost not worth it at all and layout of bldg mess up room next to elevator shaft be noisy all night long it be design so each rm have a window but open to a brick wall alley you still can NOT TELL IF it be day or night</td><tr>
<tr><td>room be clean but show SOME WEAR AND tear</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be big than most nyc hotel i have STAY AT BUT annoy at the nuance such as the small narrow hallway and the door literally hit the bed</td><tr>
<tr><td>there be a c in the room that be pretty LOUD WHEN IT be on</td><tr>
<tr><td>third the bathroom be really tiny and the tp be the THIN I HAVE ever see</td><tr>
<tr><td>for the PRICE TAG I think they should at least put flat panel tv in the room as the stupid tv console for the traditional box tv do they still sell those take up unnecessary space and ipod iphone dock should be include as well</td><tr>
<tr><td>the SHEET HAVE A very very strong chemical odor</td><tr>
<tr><td>i guess the AIR CONDITIONING ON our side of the club be break which be borderline unbearable</td><tr>
<tr><td>do not make for A NICE EVENING shower after a long day</td><tr>
<tr><td>and not in the cool i have always wonder how they fit so MANY PEOPLE IN such a small space</td><tr>
<tr><td>despite that the street noise be very noticeable likely due to poor insulation around the WINDOW AIR CONDITIONER</td><tr>
<tr><td>the housecleaning crew can have do a little bit good job in the bathroom but i shower and do my business WITH NO REAL concern about the cleanliness</td><tr>
<tr><td>but i be SURPRISED THAT THE heater do not seem to work during my stay and the window be really dirty on the outside which obfuscate the view of the city</td><tr>
<tr><td>good thing he be like anorexic because any body big than a carrot stick woudl not be ABLE TO FIT into the pocelain coffin that i feel i be soak in</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall not terrible but NOT WHAT BE expect falling short</td><tr>
<tr><td>OVERALL THE SERVICE need work but the main issue be fundamental layout issue which can not be fix</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall the service need work but the MAIN ISSUE BE fundamental layout issue which can not be fix</td><tr>
<tr><td>CHECKIN BE ON the 8th floor and they be very friendly</td><tr>
<tr><td>although everything DO ITS JOB it would be nice to spruce it up</td><tr>
<tr><td>nauseating antiseptic smell IN MY FIRST room be not an issue in the upgraded room probably be just that room requests for room such as housekeep or extra material be a bit slow probably because there be limited staff and they be keep pretty busy 15mins</td><tr>
<tr><td>do not EVEN TELL US about the complimentary continental breakfast and what time even though we late see it posted in the elevator</td><tr>
<tr><td>but there be 2 bottle of cold water and milk in the fridge and you can make coffee use coffee teabags those will taste as you WOULD EXPECT THEM to</td><tr>
<tr><td>when i mention this to the front desk the woman tell me pod term BE DIFFERENT THAN most hotel and that a wouldouble do not mean two bed</td><tr>
<tr><td>i think even a married couple may want a door to divide the bathroom and the ROOM</td><tr>
<tr><td>i wish the pool be open since we be there during warm weather and it be HEAT</td><tr>
<tr><td>the access to the mezzanine via stairs be not quite clear and the elevator be slow and unclear where to hit the button sometimes but you do NOT REALLY EXPECT modern speed amenity here</td><tr>
<tr><td>although not horrifying SERVICE THE SERVICE can improve</td><tr>
<tr><td>probably my big issue be THEY CHARGE AN access fee which be suppose cover to coffee the gym and internet</td><tr>
<tr><td>the room be small than what i be use to see but it still hold a queen bed and a plasma tv and have room for you to move around just not MUCH</td><tr>
<tr><td>think IT BE STRANGE that they claim to have room service but it be actually just from a bunch of delivery spot around the area that have nothing to do with the hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>the room HERE BE SMALL so if you be stay with more than two people it can get a little tight</td><tr>

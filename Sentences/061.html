<tr><td>we have a nice experience here but encountered A FEW PROBLEM that likely be not the norm but i think be worth sharing</td><tr>
<tr><td>yotel be fine for one night and i would NOT BE OPPOSE to stay again if i want an inexpensive night in new york</td><tr>
<tr><td>yotel be FINE FOR ONE night and i would not be oppose to stay again if i want an inexpensive night in new york</td><tr>
<tr><td>i would not call it luxurious but definitely very clean maybe a 3star if i HAVE TO GUESS</td><tr>
<tr><td>3stars because though it be A SOLID HOTEL it do not wow me enough to deserve more</td><tr>
<tr><td>i love IT I HATE IT so you get 3 star</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you be go for view i would NOT GO FOR room 324 though ^^</td><tr>
<tr><td>I WOULD AGREE to use this hotel if the price be reasonable and or you be simply there to sleep</td><tr>
<tr><td>normally i would not mind that MUCH BUT I happen to be eat takeout in the bed one night and get some stain on the sheet and i really want them change so i do not have to be smell pad thai while i sleep the next night</td><tr>

<tr><td>nice BUT SINCE THE room be a marriott category 9 high level that be about 45000 point per night it be a bit insulting</td><tr>
<tr><td>my thensoontobe boyfriend take me HERE SO WE can be alone and together for two day since we live on the two farthest borough possible</td><tr>
<tr><td>i would definitely stay here again but I WOULD HOPE FOR a good experience</td><tr>
<tr><td>we do not eat there BECAUSE THEY CHARGE 16 for a chicken sandwhich</td><tr>
<tr><td>ALSO I THINK it be ridiculous there be not a free breakfast for how much it cost to stay here especially when they charge you an extra 25 buck a day randomly</td><tr>
<tr><td>if i be TO RATE THIS hotel soley on the costbenefit i would sadly have to give this hotel one star</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall i would go back AT A DISCOUNTED rate say under 200</td><tr>
<tr><td>after return from a weekend in philly it be like check into a totally different HOTEL</td><tr>
<tr><td>OVERALL FOR THE price and location i will stay there again but definitely ask for a high floor</td><tr>
<tr><td>i do not think i would return to the hotel base on the value and treatment from the front desk but overall IT BE AOK as my 3 star would signal</td><tr>

<tr><td>disappoint the hotel restaurant be more like a cafe no real option for a true dinner they have burger and thing but again for the price it should be good next time visit ny i will probably pay the extra 2040 buck a night to stay at the westin a couple block away i have stay there before they have a fabulous property with a true hotel feel hyatt be not horrible but should have be cheap for what they be offering and hyatt also need to work on their professionalism and common courtesy when deal w guest if you can not be pleasant then deal in hospitality maybe should NOT BE YOUR job choice especially in such a high tourist destination</td><tr>

<tr><td>i still need to experience how it feel to get work do there but this be how i envision it surround by party people i be get work done WHILE SIP ON A lovely day blue agave tequila lime juice club soda huckleberry juice</td><tr>
<tr><td>i will COME BACK BUT not at 211</td><tr>
<tr><td>hmm i be NOT SURE THIS be the good policy for make but maybe their hotel fashion week guest be not as understand or polite</td><tr>
<tr><td>i quickly go online AND READ THE review and mostly see it would be hit or miss</td><tr>
<tr><td>my colleague and i be still able to spend every night there enjoy the 15 cocktail but AT TIME IT be stand room only</td><tr>
<tr><td>i come here for the instagram social medium week event THAT BE HOLD in one of the room downstairs</td><tr>
<tr><td>i know this be new york culture but i BE A STRONG believer that tip be a voluntary token of appreciation of good service that be extra and beyond what be expect</td><tr>
<tr><td>but there be an actual starbucks around THE CORNER IF YOU prefer</td><tr>
<tr><td>so i do not recommend the bar for food or drink unless you go right up to the bar and start order drink to GET THEIR ATTENTION and even then the server likely will totally ignore you if you be alone</td><tr>

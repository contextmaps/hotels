<tr><td>and do not expect to soothe your tired citybeaten soul with a warm help of the golden girls when you get back to THE ROOM EITHER despite carry enough porn to give a horny 15yearold a chafed joystick you will not find cable standard like lifetime or many other basic channel</td><tr>
<tr><td>so THE FREE DRINK be not really accessible to me after all because i can not spend three minute in that lobby without wheeze</td><tr>
<tr><td>these PEOPLE ACT LIKE this be a 4 star hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>when will these highend hotel stop rape their customer for a la carte service like 5 water bottle and PARKING FEE BE</td><tr>
<tr><td>do they even REALIZE THAT WE be already pay almost 500 a night to stay there</td><tr>
<tr><td>so yeah this review be absent the ranting fbombs and angry insult of my previous review but they still need to do a lot of work to get up to three star in my mind bar some spectacular display of extraordinary service IN MY LAST week here</td><tr>
<tr><td>right now i be give 2 star but i will UPDATE MY REVIEW after my stay</td><tr>
<tr><td>overall i feel LIKE THE STAFF be lazy and does not take care of their customer</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you stay here it be a great location for times square and they do not have a bed bug report or evidence from what i see but do not expect much in way of response CUSTOMER SERVICE OR competence</td><tr>

<tr><td>i call and it be fix RIGHT AWAY BUT for some reason i would expect more from a hotel like this one</td><tr>
<tr><td>they can charge you i kid you not 500 for a kitkat bar and 2500 for some pancake but for wiffy you have to go to THE LOBBY</td><tr>
<tr><td>the bottom line be the owner of this hotel have little attention TO DETAIL THAT travelers like me pay attention to</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be 600 night to stay HERE AND NOT GET free wifi</td><tr>
<tr><td>a friend and i be come from boston AND DECIDE WE would just stay up all night bad idea because around 3am we be crash hard</td><tr>
<tr><td>in reading other REVIEW IT SEEM like this be a constant issue here</td><tr>
<tr><td>if i would have receive the complimentary wifi i probably WOULD HAVE RATE it aok</td><tr>
<tr><td>other than this experience it be actually a good stay but with the staff behave as THEY DO I would not return</td><tr>
<tr><td>after 25 hour of drink not 1 of the 8 people in our party even have a buzz 40 sound like a great deal for unlimited hot and cold plate food be very good along with bottomless drink but to finish the meal and leave without even a buzz BE VERY DISAPPOINTING</td><tr>
<tr><td>I GUESS THIS property be struggle to make end meet since it be really important to ms snyder to snag that extra coin</td><tr>
<tr><td>there be no hot water it only get warm and at 389 per NIGHT I EXPECT MORE</td><tr>
<tr><td>im give two STAR BECAUSE THE LOCATION be descent</td><tr>
<tr><td>while i stay at this location often for business it really bother me when i start hear door be knock on in the hallway AT 9AM AND housekeep housekeep housekeep</td><tr>
<tr><td>this suck when carry LUGGAGE IN A hurry etcno one be ever in the downstairs lobby</td><tr>
<tr><td>when we first ARRIVE FOR OUR 9 night stay in nyc we be greet by no one</td><tr>
<tr><td>this hotel BE ADVERTISE AS 4 out of 5 star there be no way this should be 45</td><tr>
<tr><td>WO NOT BE BACK UNLESS I can invent a way to shrink my size to that of an umpa lumpa</td><tr>
<tr><td>i book a room here for two night via hotwire which does not disclose the name of THE HOTEL UNTIL after you have pay for it but have a pretty good hunch that this be where my friend and i would end up</td><tr>
<tr><td>i book a room here for two night via hotwire which does not disclose the name of the hotel until AFTER YOU HAVE pay for it but have a pretty good hunch that this be where my friend and i would end up</td><tr>
<tr><td>if the price be right i may consider stay here again but LOCATION DOES NOT make up for cruddy hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>one example be the fact that you have to shell out 10 to use their gym it does HAVE A GIANT projector hook up to a wii</td><tr>
<tr><td>while i will not stay at this hotel again i do BELIEVE THAT THEY recognize the problem and will work hard to find a solution</td><tr>
<tr><td>i get that they be try to build a cheeky and casual experience but my impression of the hotel be that a rich kid invest some money into it hire their friend and call themselves the next hot PLACE IN TOWN</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be my husband and i be first wedding night and we be hope for a special and relaxing time instead we dreaded every moment because the bed be very uncomfortable and we have basic cable which most OF THE CHANNEL BE fuzzy or unclear</td><tr>
<tr><td>every time we leave the room FOR THE AFTERNOON we come back to find it overwhelmingly reeking of rancid vegetable oil</td><tr>
<tr><td>every time we leave the room for the afternoon we come BACK TO FIND it overwhelmingly reeking of rancid vegetable oil</td><tr>
<tr><td>felt as if i speak with a lisp i WOULD HAVE RECEIVE good service</td><tr>
<tr><td>it does not make up for the rest so stay SOMEWHERE ELSE AND when need meet up with friend in the lounge instead</td><tr>
<tr><td>i leave a decent tip it be the day after thanksgiving AFTER ALL BUT after pay 85 for two guinesses and one glass of house wine diffidently serve i will not be back anytime soon</td><tr>
<tr><td>to be fair no formwas present in the room prior TO SEND THE laundry out</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you be interested in feel like you HAVE GO BACK in time this can make your trip</td><tr>

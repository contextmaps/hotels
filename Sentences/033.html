<tr><td>anyway i originally book a reservation for 6 room BUT BE GIVE 4 room</td><tr>
<tr><td>on a previous trip to nyc i WANT TO WAKE up early to go get a cronut but as people get in line as early as 6am it be not happen for me as i stay near times square last time</td><tr>
<tr><td>i flick through the channel to find myself back AT THE START within 30 second do i really just go through all the channel already</td><tr>
<tr><td>the picture on THE WEBSITE MAKE the hotel and the room look much nicer and new than they really be</td><tr>
<tr><td>here be the scoop firstly i probably risk sound like snoot factor five when i SAY THIS BUT i do not really appreciate be treat informally by staff member when i be a customer</td><tr>
<tr><td>i like to be warm when i BE SLEEP BUT i spend a full 3045 minute shiver under the cover before i be warm enough to fall asleep</td><tr>

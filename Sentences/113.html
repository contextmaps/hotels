<tr><td>THIS HOTEL LOBBY bar be design to mimic a library with shelf of book and long table for study</td><tr>
<tr><td>easygoing people and original atmosphere but i be not a big fan of the MUSIC WHICH BE pretty commercial</td><tr>
<tr><td>just a very small room very typical of ny so not a big complaint but the room BE VERY DARK AND we have a leak in the window sill which unfortunately during a middle of the night rain storm do not fair well for some clothing that be out of the suitcase</td><tr>
<tr><td>first this hotel lobby be very DARK IT BE like enter a night club</td><tr>
<tr><td>THE RATE THEY charge be absurd for old room thinner wall and no charging port near the bed</td><tr>
<tr><td>the bar staff BE VERY ATTRACTIVE but they do not notice when your drink be empty and they have no food service at the bar bowl of stale pretzel does not count</td><tr>
<tr><td>the carpeting be pretty but really dark and never seem TO BE FULLY vacuumed</td><tr>
<tr><td>THE CARPETING BE pretty but really dark and never seem to be fully vacuumed</td><tr>
<tr><td>the drink BE OVERPRICED BUT the bartender pour heavy</td><tr>
<tr><td>another example would be the inroom entertainment it be a bit convoluted as far as you have to download an app then pair your device just TO PLAY MUSIC</td><tr>
<tr><td>the location be pretty awesome even though it be hidden under scaffolding but THE POOL TABLE be in the center of four large square column that totally screw up your shot if you be try from that angle sighs if there be a 2 12 star rating i would probably give it that</td><tr>

<tr><td>you can go to the vending machine for snacks that be 350 and the machine TAKE CREDIT CARD and the location it be not close to anything</td><tr>

<tr><td>small room BUT TYPICAL FOR the area</td><tr>
<tr><td>while i will likely stay at the rog again due to the rate and convenience i have learn to try to book a room with A BIG BATHROOM and on a low floor in a quiet room away from the street</td><tr>
<tr><td>i guess B C THE place be call le bleu the management feel compel to utilize horrible blue lighting in the lobby and the elevator</td><tr>
<tr><td>it be adequate FOR SHORT STAY</td><tr>
<tr><td>everything else SEEM CLEAN</td><tr>
<tr><td>the room itself BE RELATIVELY CLEAN AND the absence of bedbug always get an extra star in manhattan</td><tr>
<tr><td>what we do not like the 95 surprise at checkout for taxis and mysterious property fee lack of heat in our room which required a portable space heater be provide very tiny BATHROOM</td><tr>
<tr><td>room nice mini size good enough lobby always busy with PEOPLE SIT ON couch do absolutely nothing except be zombie stare at computer</td><tr>
<tr><td>oh and wifi be free AS WELL</td><tr>
<tr><td>we get ajoining room but one still have a KING BED</td><tr>
<tr><td>i also decide to utilize the fitness center on the 3rd FLOOR TO FIND that it be make up of 2 ellipticals 3 treadmill and some free weight</td><tr>
<tr><td>however THEY ADVERTISE THAT there be free wifi but that be actually an extra fee that you need to pay in the resort fee</td><tr>
<tr><td>REALLY WISH THE service be just slightly more attentive it would make all the difference</td><tr>
<tr><td>true it be small but it be suppose to be design SO AS TO maximize space</td><tr>
<tr><td>this place get 3 start only BECAUSE ROOM BE pretty big and because bell boy that work there be very nice</td><tr>
<tr><td>so downsides first at least in winter the cold requires you to keep your heavy blackout shade down which mean your room feel very dark unless YOU WOULD RATHER have your room feel very cold</td><tr>

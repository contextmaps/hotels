<tr><td>the bar be a nice place to sit however the staff can use some help short not helpful at all and act for the most part put out to be serve you so strange that they be work for tip but seem miserable and like they really just want YOU TO GO AWAY</td><tr>
<tr><td>350 a night include all taxis and fee but after have half my internet charge remove because the connection do not function most of the time buys you a smallish room that may have be great before electricity but be now just a few biohazardous stain and a vice squad raid short of something you would expect for 20 AN HOUR AT hotsheet hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>despite the condition of the room i do feel LIKE I SHOULD be fair by mention the good thing</td><tr>
<tr><td>if YOU BE OVER anything that involve club 18 cocktail kardashian wannabes or creepy old man grope young girl maybe skip this place</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you be over anything that involve club 18 cocktail kardashian wannabes or creepy old man grope young girl maybe SKIP THIS PLACE</td><tr>
<tr><td>the elevator be probably the BAD PART ABOUT the hotel</td><tr>
<tr><td>however if it be rain as it be when i stay june expect the lobby to consist of a COUPLE OF PEOPLE tap away on their laptop and no buzz no chatter or socialising whatsoever</td><tr>
<tr><td>unless YOU BE UNDER 40 this may not be the hotel for you</td><tr>
<tr><td>or i would HAVE DO THAT</td><tr>
<tr><td>the STAFF CAN CARE less</td><tr>
<tr><td>this hotel be a big DISAPPOINTMENT</td><tr>
<tr><td>a deal for 5 drink til 8pm pop up when i check in on foursquare which BE NICE SINCE mix drink be normally about 12</td><tr>
<tr><td>businessman for a few minute but be advise not to entertain any upstairs in your tiny room OR ELSE YOU will sympathize with derek zoolander and find yourself ask what be this a center for ants</td><tr>
<tr><td>meanwhile a well dress man stay at the hotel ON HIS WAY out get a good morning greeting and a smile</td><tr>
<tr><td>WHAT A SHAME</td><tr>
<tr><td>after sleep on this for a week my hip knee BE KILL ME</td><tr>
<tr><td>WHEN I PAY ok my company pay that much i expect decent value which i certainly do not get</td><tr>
<tr><td>when we come back to the hotel our room BE READY BUT we have difficulty access the room which end up happen more than once</td><tr>
<tr><td>REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY bad</td><tr>
<tr><td>i give it two star because it be a NICE LOOK HOTEL</td><tr>
<tr><td>internet service be not include in the room in this age of FREE WIFI AT chain hotel and cost 1995 a day</td><tr>
<tr><td>i would have have to have use a dialup service what BE THIS THE 90s</td><tr>
<tr><td>far they make no meaningful effort to quite the party down i guess they PAY MORE THAN us bottom line we will not be back</td><tr>
<tr><td>the room itself be generally good but WHEN THE SHOWER door fog up you can tell that part of the glass have not be clean for some time</td><tr>
<tr><td>if this hotel invest less in their lobby and more in their ROOM THEY WOULD be a good deal</td><tr>
<tr><td>so i find his mannerisms to BE ODD AND offputting</td><tr>
<tr><td>terrible insulation THIN WALL I can hear hipsters hobnob all night long</td><tr>
<tr><td>the room be THE SMALL HOTEL ROOM i have ever be in probably 8x13 include the bathroom</td><tr>
<tr><td>also while almost every motel in the country offer free internet service in this 550 per night room the internet cost 10 PER DAY</td><tr>
<tr><td>if you need dependable internet find SOMEWHERE ELSE</td><tr>
